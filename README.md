# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Course Description

The course I plan to teach is AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science, including problem-solving, programming, algorithms, data, the internet, and the global impact of computing. Students also develop skills in abstraction, collaboration, creativity, and communication.

The course emphasizes both block-based programming (Scratch) and text-based programming (Python/JavaScript), while integrating computational thinking into real-world applications. Students will also complete the Create Performance Task (developing a program) as part of the AP assessment.

### Situation

Teaching Context

Grade Level: 10th–12th grade students.

Class Size: Approximately 12 students per section.

Student Demographics: Our demographic is a primarily white, lower to middle-class population with a variety of technology access at home. Most are first time CS learners with little to no coding experience other than the occasional "Day of Code" experience.

Classroom Environment: Our computer lab would provide 1:1 access for students to a high-end, modern gaming PC. Additionally, all students have their own, school-provided, Chromebook with internet access at school and home. The classroom also includes a smart board and a TV wall(4 large smart TV's) capable of mirroring a techer PC.

School Technology Access: The school has high-speed wifi access for all PC's and Chromebooks; however, there are some restrictions on information available to students. Additionally, students use Canvas for all classes and student verions of Adobe Creative Cloud and Google applications.

I am my current public high school setting, though the plan can be adapted for different schools or district requirements.

### Application

Students will use this technology to code in Scratch and python. GitHub and Canvas will be used for project submission, collaboration, and version control. All assignments will be distributed via Canvas, where students will also submit their work. Feedback will be given through Canvas comments, GitHub pull request reviews, and rubric-based assessments. Lessons will be broken into short modules (20–30 minutes) with practice checkpoints. Lessons will use pair programming, peer review sessions, and interactive coding challenges to encourage active learning.<br/>


Pedagogical Strategies:

Pair Programming to encourage collaboration.

Flipped Classroom for certain lessons, with video lectures assigned as homework and class time focused on coding labs.

Differentiated Instruction through self-paced coding platforms and extension projects for advanced learners.

### Impacts

Students gain hands-on coding experience while practicing collaboration and critical thinking. They will develop digital literacy and computational thinking applicable across fields. The plan shifts the classroom toward student-centered learning, encouraging exploration and peer teaching. Technology supports scaffolding and allows flexible pacing. Accessibility tools and cloud-based platforms ensure all students can participate, even those with limited home access. Pair programming and collaborative platforms also ensure equitable involvement. If instruction moves online, all tools (Canvas, GitHub, Google Suite) remain fully functional remotely, minimizing disruption. Video lessons and virtual office hours would replace in-person instruction.
