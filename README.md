# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Course Description

The course I plan to teach is AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science, including problem-solving, programming, algorithms, data, the internet, and the global impact of computing. Students also develop skills in abstraction, collaboration, creativity, and communication.

The course emphasizes both block-based programming (Scratch, App Inventor) and text-based programming (Python/JavaScript), while integrating computational thinking into real-world applications. Students will also complete the Create Performance Task (developing a program) as part of the AP assessment.

### Situation

Teaching Context

Grade Level: 10th–12th grade students.

Class Size: Approximately 25 students per section.

Student Demographics: Mixed demographic population with varying levels of technology access at home. About 30% are first-time CS learners; 10% have prior coding experience.

Classroom Environment: Computer lab with 1:1 desktops for students, plus students’ ability to bring personal laptops if needed. Projector and smartboard available for lessons.

School Technology Access: Reliable broadband internet (1 Gbps), cloud-based LMS (Google Classroom), and access to Google Workspace for Education.

I am assuming this is a public high school setting, though the plan can be adapted for different schools or district requirements.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Software

Operating Systems: Windows 11 on desktops, teacher laptop with dual-boot (Windows/Linux) for flexibility

Learning Management System (LMS): Google Classroom

Programming Environments:

Scratch (for block-based projects)

Thonny IDE (Python)

Repl.it (cloud coding & collaboration)

GitHub Classroom (version control & project collaboration)

Multimedia Tools:

Canva & Adobe Express (for project visuals and presentations)

WeVideo (for digital storytelling projects)

Communication Tools: Google Meet, Gmail, and LMS-integrated messaging

Accessibility Tools: Text-to-speech readers, closed-captioning for videos, and high-contrast display settings
### Hardware Specifications

Hardware

Instructor Laptop

Dell Inspiron 15 (or equivalent)

Intel Core i5, quad-core 4.0 GHz

16 GB RAM

512 GB SSD

External HDMI connection for projector/smartboard

Student Desktops (25 workstations)

Dell Optiplex with 20" monitors

Intel Core i3, 3.2 GHz

8 GB RAM

500 GB HDD

Classroom printer for project handouts and student work submission (as needed)

Headsets with microphones for students (for coding tutorials, accessibility, and collaboration)

Network Infrastructure

Gigabit Ethernet in lab; schoolwide Wi-Fi for laptops/mobile devices

Firewall and content filtering for safe browsing

Cloud-hosted LMS and tools (Google, GitHub, Repl.it)

### Application

Application

Students will use this technology in the following ways:

Coding & Projects: Students will code in Python (via Thonny/Repl.it) and Scratch. GitHub Classroom will be used for project submission, collaboration, and version control.

Assignments & Feedback: Assignments will be distributed via Google Classroom, where students will also submit their work. Feedback will be given through Google Docs comments, GitHub pull request reviews, and rubric-based assessments.

Multimedia Learning Principles in Practice:

Coherence: PowerPoint slides and coding examples will avoid extraneous text and visuals.

Segmenting: Lessons broken into short modules (20–30 minutes) with practice checkpoints.

Modality: Visual diagrams paired with verbal explanations during lectures.

Active Learning: Pair programming, peer review sessions, and interactive coding challenges.

Personalization: Instructor videos and tutorials presented in a conversational style.

Pedagogical Strategies:

Pair Programming to encourage collaboration.

Flipped Classroom for certain lessons, with video lectures assigned as homework and class time focused on coding labs.

Differentiated Instruction through self-paced coding platforms and extension projects for advanced learners.

### Impacts

Impacts

Learning Impacts: Students gain hands-on coding experience while practicing collaboration and critical thinking. They will develop digital literacy and computational thinking applicable across fields.

Pedagogical Impacts: The plan shifts the classroom toward student-centered learning, encouraging exploration and peer teaching. Technology supports scaffolding and allows flexible pacing.

Inclusion Impacts: Accessibility tools and cloud-based platforms ensure all students can participate, even those with limited home access. Pair programming and collaborative platforms also ensure equitable involvement.

Contingency Planning: If instruction moves online, all tools (Google Classroom, Repl.it, GitHub, Meet) remain fully functional remotely, minimizing disruption. Video lessons and virtual office hours would replace in-person instruction.
