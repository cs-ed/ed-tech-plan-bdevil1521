# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Course Description

The course I plan to teach is AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science, including problem-solving, programming, algorithms, data, the internet, and the global impact of computing. Students also develop skills in abstraction, collaboration, creativity, and communication.

The course emphasizes both block-based programming (Scratch, App Inventor) and text-based programming (Python/JavaScript), while integrating computational thinking into real-world applications. Students will also complete the Create Performance Task (developing a program) as part of the AP assessment.

### Situation

Teaching Context

Grade Level: 10th–12th grade students.

Class Size: Approximately 12 students per section.

Student Demographics: Our demographic is a primarily white, lower to middle-class population with a variety of technology access at home. Most are first time CS learners with little to no coding experience other than the occasional "Day of Code" experience.

Classroom Environment: Our computer lab would provide 1:1 access for students to a high-end, modern gaming PC. Additionally, all students have their own, school-provided, Chromebook with internet access at school and home. The classroom also includes a smart board and a TV wall(4 large smart TV's) capable of mirroring a techer PC.

School Technology Access: The school has high-speed wifi access for all PC's and Chromebooks; however, there are some restrictions on information available to students. Additionally, students use Canvas for all classes and student verions of Adobe Creative Cloud and Google applications.

I am my current public high school setting, though the plan can be adapted for different schools or district requirements.

### Application

Application

Students will use this technology in the following ways:
Coding & Projects: Students will code in Python (via Thonny/Repl.it) and Scratch. GitHub Classroom will be used for project submission, collaboration, and version control.

Assignments & Feedback: Assignments will be distributed via Google Classroom, where students will also submit their work. Feedback will be given through Google Docs comments, GitHub pull request reviews, and rubric-based assessments.

Multimedia Learning Principles in Practice:

Coherence: PowerPoint slides and coding examples will avoid extraneous text and visuals.

Segmenting: Lessons broken into short modules (20–30 minutes) with practice checkpoints.

Modality: Visual diagrams paired with verbal explanations during lectures.

Active Learning: Pair programming, peer review sessions, and interactive coding challenges.

Personalization: Instructor videos and tutorials presented in a conversational style.

Pedagogical Strategies:

Pair Programming to encourage collaboration.

Flipped Classroom for certain lessons, with video lectures assigned as homework and class time focused on coding labs.

Differentiated Instruction through self-paced coding platforms and extension projects for advanced learners.

### Impacts

Impacts

Learning Impacts: Students gain hands-on coding experience while practicing collaboration and critical thinking. They will develop digital literacy and computational thinking applicable across fields.

Pedagogical Impacts: The plan shifts the classroom toward student-centered learning, encouraging exploration and peer teaching. Technology supports scaffolding and allows flexible pacing.

Inclusion Impacts: Accessibility tools and cloud-based platforms ensure all students can participate, even those with limited home access. Pair programming and collaborative platforms also ensure equitable involvement.

Contingency Planning: If instruction moves online, all tools (Google Classroom, Repl.it, GitHub, Meet) remain fully functional remotely, minimizing disruption. Video lessons and virtual office hours would replace in-person instruction.
